As a technology professional with over 7+ years of experience in software engineering and applied machine learning, I have contributed to the development of scalable backend systems, intelligent web applications, and AI-powered solutions across diverse industries, including healthcare, cloud infrastructure, and customer engagement. I hold a Master’s degree in Information Technology from Finland, which complements my hands-on expertise with a strong academic foundation. Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Huawei Finland, while continuing to engage in research and innovation at the intersection of AI and real-world application design.

My professional vision is to drive the implementation of AI in modern applications, particularly through the convergence of machine learning and full-stack software engineering. I aim to bridge R&D with deployable technologies by building intelligent agents that enhance human decision-making in sectors like healthcare, marketing automation, and customer support systems. My passion lies in developing robust, ethical, and scalable AI systems that are not only research-proven but also production-ready—bringing meaningful change to businesses and society through smart, efficient automation.

I welcome collaboration with companies, research institutions, and startups working at the frontier of AI and digital transformation. Previously, I collaborated with the Medical Scribe Research Group at Metropolia University, focusing on intelligent transcription systems for clinical use, and the Lakehead University research group, where we worked on machine learning applications in healthcare diagnostics. If your team is exploring AI-driven innovation—especially where it intersects with software architecture, NLP, or medical technologies—I’d be glad to collaborate, consult, or co-develop impactful solutions.
